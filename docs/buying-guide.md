# Buying Guide for Used Shipping Containers  

Purchasing a used shipping container can be cost-effective, but requires careful consideration.  

## ✅ Key Steps  

1. **Choose the Right Size**  
   - 20ft (ideal for small storage)  
   - 40ft (standard for transport & larger storage)  
   - High Cube (extra height for modification projects)  

2. **Check the Container Condition**  
   - One-trip: Like new, used once  
   - Cargo-worthy (CW): Certified for shipping  
   - Wind & Water Tight (WWT): Suitable for storage  
   - As-is: Lowest cost but may need repairs  

3. **Inspect Before Buying**  
   - Check for rust, dents, and flooring condition  
   - Ensure doors close and lock properly  
   - Verify no major structural damage  

4. **Understand Pricing**  
   - Prices vary by location, availability, and condition  
   - Expect $2,000 – $5,000 USD depending on type  

5. **Plan for Delivery**  
   - Confirm transport options (tilt-bed truck, crane, forklift)  
   - Ensure your site is accessible for delivery  

## ⚠️ Tips  
- Always buy from trusted suppliers  
- Request recent pictures or visit the yard  
- Factor delivery costs into your budget
